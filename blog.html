        <h2>Some question in JS</h2>
        <div>
            <h1>1.What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
            <p>In Local storage can store 5-10mb offline data. Session Storage: It is same like local storage date
                except it will delete all windows when browser windows closed by a web user. Session: A session is a
                global variable stored on the server. Each session is assigned a unique id which is used to retrieve
                stored values.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>2.What is the difference between local and global variables in JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>Local Variable: When you use JavaScript, local variables are variables that are defined within functions.
                They have local scope, which means that they can only be used within the functions that define them.
                Global Variable: In contrast, global variables are variables that are defined outside of functions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>3.How does loop work in JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>- for - loops through a block of code a number of times. - for/in - loops through the properties of an
                object. - while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true. - do/while - loops
                through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>4.How many ways to get undefined?</h1>
            <p>To check undefined in JavaScript, use (===) triple equals operator. In modern browsers, you can compare
                the variable directly to undefined using the triple equals operator. There are also two more ways to
                check if the variable is undefined or not in JavaScript, but those ways are not recommended.</p>
