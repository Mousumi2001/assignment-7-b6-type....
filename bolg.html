            <h2>What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
            <p>In Local storage can store 5-10mb offline data. Session Storage: It is same like local storage date
                except it will delete all windows when browser windows closed by a web user. Session: A session is a
                global variable stored on the server. Each session is assigned a unique id which is used to retrieve
                stored values.</p>

            <h1>What is the difference between local and global variables in JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>Local Variable: When you use JavaScript, local variables are variables that are defined within functions.
                They have local scope, which means that they can only be used within the functions that define them.
                Global Variable: In contrast, global variables are variables that are defined outside of functions.
